    <h2>Origin of Adobo</h2>
    <p>The story of adobo begins long before Spanish colonization, rooted in the indigenous practices of the Philippines. The word “adobo” is derived from the Spanish term adobar, which means “to marinate.” However, the dish itself existed even before Spanish influence reached the archipelago. Early Filipinos relied on vinegar and salt to preserve meat, especially in the tropical climate where food spoils quickly. This simple preservation method not only kept food edible but also infused it with a tangy, savoury flavour that would later define adobo’s iconic taste. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, they introduced soy sauce, garlic, and other spices, further enhancing the dish’s flavor profile. Over time, the combination of indigenous techniques and Spanish influences transformed adobo into a uniquely Filipino dish. Despite its Spanish root , the history of adobo reflects a distinctly Filipino identity; adobo evolved into a national treasure, embodying the country resourcefulness and cultural diversity. summarize this</p>
